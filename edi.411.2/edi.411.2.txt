  This data package includes data and code from an experiment testing
  the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus addition on interactions
  between two grass viruses (BYDV-PAV and CYDV-RPV). Data include virus
  density within oats (Avena sativa) and transmission of viruses to a
  second set of oats. Data were collected by Amy E. Kendig and
  collaborators between February 2014 and August 2014 at the University
  of Minnesota in St. Paul Minnesota, USA. Experiments were performed in
  growth chambers, virus density data were obtained using one-step
  reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction
  (RT-qPCR), and transmission data were obtained using RT-PCR. The code
  includes statistical analyses and figures. Model objects created
  through statistical analyses are also included. The code was run using
  R (version 3.5.2).

  Motivation: Ecological theory that predicts the effects of resource
  availability on species interactions has been explored across a range
  of systems. Yet, application of this theory to communities of
  host-associated pathogens has been limited. Host resources and diet
  can impact disease severity and prevalence, and these resource effects
  on disease may be mediated by pathogen-pathogen interactions within
  hosts infected with multiple pathogens. As with free-living organisms,
  pathogen species can alter each other’s population growth rates,
  population densities, and transmission to new hosts through
  facilitative or antagonistic processes. We used a model grass-virus
  system (Barley and Cereal Yellow Dwarf Viruses in Avena sativa) to
  test the hypothesis that host nutrition can constrain virus-virus
  interactions by simultaneously determining both within-host density
  and transmission to new hosts.

          
  Design: The experiment consisted of twelve treatments: four host
  nutrient treatments crossed with three inoculation treatments. Host
  nutrients were manipulated by watering Avena sativa with one of four
  modified Hoagland solutions (7.5 μM N and 1 μM P (Low), 7.5 μM N and
  50 μM P (P), 375 μM N and 1 μM P (N), or 375 μM N and 50 μM P (N+P)).
  Watering began two days after planting A. sativa seeds in 164 mL
  conical pots with 70% Sunshine medium vermiculite (vermiculite and
  less than 1% crystalline silica; Sun Gro Horticulture) and 30% Turface
  MVP (calcined clay containing up to 30% crystalline silica; Turface
  Athletics, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). A. sativa were watered with 30 mL
  of nutrient solution twice per week prior to inoculation and weekly
  following inoculation. Inoculation treatments consisted of BYDV-PAV
  (PAV, hereafter), CYDV-RPV (RPV, hereafter), or both. Plants were
  inoculated ten to eleven days post planting using ten aphids
  (Rhopalosiphum padi) per plant (PAV: five aphids carrying PAV, five
  mock-inoculated; RPV: five carrying RPV, five mock-inoculated; both:
  five carrying PAV, five carrying RPV). We conducted transmission
  trials by placing 25 aphids on this first set of plants (i.e., the
  source plants), allowing them to feed, and transferring five of the
  aphids to each of four uninfected plants grown in the four nutrient
  treatments (i.e., the receiving plants). Transmission trials took
  place when source plants were harvested. Plants were maintained in a
  growth chamber at 20 degrees C with a 16:8 h light:dark cycle under
  28W bulbs. We destructively harvested the source plants at eight
  different days post inoculation (DPI): 5, 8, 12, 16, 19, 22, 26, or 29
  days. We stored approximately 60% of the source plant tissue at -80
  degrees C and used the rest for the transmission trials. The receiving
  plants were harvested 14-15 DPI and all of the stem and leaf tissue
  was stored at -80 degrees C. The experiment was performed over five
  temporal blocks with one to two treatment-by-harvesting day replicates
  (n = 96) per block.

          
  Plant Measurements: At each harvesting day, we measured chlorophyll
  three times along the largest leaf on each plant using a SPAD-502
  (Konica Minolta, Tokyo, Japan). Then, we split the plants into shoots
  (stem and leaves) and roots by dividing them at the highest roots. We
  weighed the aboveground tissue immediately, and the belowground tissue
  after rinsing with tap water and drying on paper towels. Stems and
  leaves were scanned (Seiko Epson Crop, Suwa, Japan) and analyzed for
  area and perimeter with ImageJ software (Rasband 2014).

          
  Virus Density: To quantify virus density (number of viruses per mg
  plant) in source plants, we first thawed approximately 50 mg of
  haphazardly chosen cut plant tissue from the portion stored at -80
  degrees C. We extracted total RNA from the plant tissue following the
  manufacturer’s instructions for TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo
  Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). We divided the RNA extract into
  three technical replicates and used one-step reverse
  transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to obtain
  estimates of the number of copies of PAV and RPV RNA within each
  sample. We used the RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (Applied Biosystems, Thermo
  Fisher Scientific), primers, probes, and standards designed for PAV
  and RPV, and the Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus Real-time PCR System.
  To estimate the density of PAV or RPV in a plant, we took the mean of
  the concentration (copies/ul) in the technical replicates (wells),
  calculated the copies in the 50 ul of total RNA extract, and then
  divided it by the mass of plant tissue used for the RNA extraction.
  Some of the samples were also analyzed with reverse transcription,
  polymerase chain reaction, and gel electrophoresis following the
  methods presented by Lacroix et al. (2014) in order to screen for
  accidental infections.

          
  Virus Transmission: To test the transmission success of receiving
  plants, we first extracted the total RNA following the methods
  described in Virus Density. We then followed the methods presented by
  Lacroix et al. (2014) for reverse transcription, polymerase chain
  reaction, and gel electrophoresis.

          
  Analysis Decisions: We excluded standards from analysis if they had a
  lower density than any detected negative controls (i.e., water;
  indicating a potential false positive). Samples in runs with standard
  curves outside the target efficiency range (85% - 115%) were
  re-analyzed when possible but excluded in analyses otherwise. We
  removed technical replicates that were detected, but outside of the
  standard curve. Non-detected technical replicates were included in the
  mean as zero density and non-detected samples (i.e. all replicates
  were not detected) were included in the analysis of infection rate,
  but not virus density. Only source plants with quantified virus
  densities corresponding to their inoculation treatment were used in
  the analysis of transmission. Plants with accidental infections
  (i.e. PAV detected in RPV-inoculated plants and RPV detected in
  PAV-inoculated plants) were included in analyses as singly infected
  plants because the timing of the accidental infection was unknown.
  Such infections may have been caused by small aphids that escaped
  inoculation cages (no other insects were observed on the experimental
  plants).

          
  Analysis: We performed all statistical analyses in R version 3.5.2. To
  analyze the effects of nutrient addition and coinfection on virus
  density in source plants, the infection rate of source plants, and
  transmission to receiving plants, we fit Bayesian generalized linear
  models to data for each virus species using the brms package (Bürkner
  2017). Virus density was modeled with a Gaussian distribution and
  formatted as ln(density) ~ coinoculation * N addition * P addition,
  where coinoculation, N addition, and P addition were binary variables.
  Harvesting day was included as a first-order autocorrelation structure
  (cor_ar function). Source plant infection was modeled with a Bernoulli
  distribution (logit-link) and formatted as infection ~ coinoculation *
  N addition * P addition. Harvesting day was included as a random
  effect because autocorrelation structures were not compatible with
  this family of models. Transmission was also modeled with a Bernoulli
  distribution (logit-link) and formatted as transmission ~ density *
  (Nsource * Psource + Nreceiving * Preceiving) + coinfection * (Nsource
  * Psource + Nreceiving * Preceiving), where the subscripts indicate
  which plant the nutrient treatment was applied to, and density was
  centered and scaled. Harvesting day and experimental block were
  included as crossed random effects. We used data from a previous
  experiment that measured PAV and RPV densities and transmission under
  almost identical laboratory conditions to inform the priors for the
  density and transmission models (Lacroix et al. 2017). All models were
  run with three Markov chains, 6000 iterations each with a 1000
  iteration warm-up. We used r-hat values, visualizations of chain
  convergence, and visual comparisons of the observed data and simulated
  data from the posterior predictive distributions to evaluate model
  fit. All packages and versions are reported in the code.
