We performed in silico and in vivo mutual invasions tests with BYDV-PAV and CYDV-RPV across N and P supply rates. We first developed a model and then performed an experiment, both of which evaluated the outcomes of viral mutual invasion tests in the host Avena sativa L. cv. Coast Black Oat grown with one of four resource availability treatments (low N and P, elevated N, elevated P, or elevated N and P). The model combined within-host nutrient concentrations with viral dynamics to identify virus characteristics that could influence whether primary infections prevented or enabled secondary infections, depending on resource availability. Model results indicated that high nutrient requirements of the invading virus or high use of a limited nutrient by the resident virus could prevent mutual invasion. Our empirical results indicated, however, that mutual invasion was possible for either BYDV-PAV or CYDV-RPV regardless of resource availability.
