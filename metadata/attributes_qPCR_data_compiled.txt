quantity_sd	the standard deviation of the quantities associated with a single sample-target combination	numeric	dimensionless		NA	not applicable
auto_threshold	indicator variable for whether or not the threshold was set automatically	categorical			NA	not applicable
threshold	the level of fluorescence above the baseline and within the exponential amplification region	numeric	dimensionless		NA	not applicable
